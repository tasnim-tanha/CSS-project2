            In this study, a mathematical model was developed to express the components of soil-metal sliding resistance for a clay soil as functions of applied normal stress and sliding path length. The model is restricted to soil containing enough moisture to exhibit cohesive strength, but not so much moisture to exhibit gross plastic behavior. Soil-metal sliding resistance data, different from those used to develop the model, were acceptably simulated, as the mean square error between the simulated sliding resistance and the measured sliding resistance ranged from 0.653 to 2.44.
